Two types of resistance exist: partial resistant and qualitative resistance. Partial resistance (or tolerance) results in fewer pustules, reduced sporulation, and lower germination rates. Disease spread and the development of epidemics are slower. Qualitative resistance is based on single genes providing total resistance. The trouble with this kind of resistance is that it may encourage the selection of new strains of the rust that can overcome varietal resistance.\n",

Polygenic (multiple gene) resistance is expressed in plants as a reduction in lesion size, lesion number and sporulation, and a longer latent period before conidia are produced. Monogenic (single gene) resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene and can be expressed as chlorotic lesions with decreased sporulation.\n",
      "3.A combination of rotating away from corn for one year followed by tillage is recommended to prevent the development of NCLB. Rotating to a non-host crop can reduce disease levels by allowing the corn debris on which the fungus survives to decompose before corn is planted again. Burying residue may help reduce infection levels by decreasing the amount of primary inoculum available in the spring. In no-till and reduced-tillage fields with a history of NCLB, a two-year rotation away from corn may be necessary. \n",

In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy.

      "3. Open up that canopy. Open canopies have a number of benefits for disease control: They reduce relative humidity to discourage fungal attack, increase sunlight exposure to toughen fruit skins and kill fungal spores, and improve spray coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      "3.Burn, bury or hot compost tomato debris at the end of the season.  Wait at least one year before planting tomatoes in a given location again, and remove and burn, bury or hot compost any volunteer tomatoes that come up in your garden.\n",

      "4.Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\n",
      "5.For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\n",

      "Tomato___Leaf_Mold\n",
      "1.Upon noticing the infected areas, the first step is to let the plants air out and dry. If they are being cultivated in a greenhouse, expose them to dry air conditions, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive and thrive is dried up in the open air.\n",
      "2.If the tomatoes are being cultivated outdoors, try to keep the leaves dry when watering the plants. One thing you can do to help keep the leaves as dry as possible is to water in the early morning hours, that way the plant has plenty of time to dry before the sun comes out, which will keep the humidity around the leaves low.\n",
      "3.You can also try drip irrigation methods, or soak watering methods to attempt to water the soil without ever wetting the leaves of the plant.\n",
      "4.Another treatment option is fungicidal sprays. When using fungicide sprays, be sure to thoroughly cover all parts of the plant that is above ground, focusing specifically on the underside of leaves. Calcium chloride sprays are among the most highly recommended types for leaf mold.\n",

      "3.Use a thick layer of mulch to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will reduce weeds and prevent the disease pathogen from splashing back up onto the leaves.\n",
      "4.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n",

      "1.The best way to begin treating for two-spotted mites is to apply a pesticide specific to mites called a miticide. Ideally, you should start treating for two-spotted mites before your plants are seriously damaged.\n",
      "2.Watch for spider mites in greenhouses where vegetable transplants are growing. Also scout eggplants in the field. Checking for mites must be done by examining foliage.\n",
      "3.Mites often develop as localized infestations on particular groups of plants such as beans or tomatoes. Sample plants by turning over leaves and with a hands-free magnifier (Optivisor) or hand lens, check for the presence of spider mites as well as symptoms or webbing.\n",

      "Tomato___Target_Spot\n",
      "1.Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.\n",
      "2.Rotate crops and don't plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year – primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.\n",
      "3.Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren't crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.\n",
      "4.Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit to mulch to 3 inches or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails.\n",

      "Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus\n",
      "1.symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost! The goal is to remove the plant reservoir of virus from the garden and to trap the existing virus-bearing whiteflies so they do not disperse onto other tomatoes.\n",
      "2.If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost.\n",
      "3.Inspect plants for whitefly infestations two times per week. If whiteflies are beginning to appear, spray with azadirachtin (Neem), pyrethrin or insecticidal soap. For more effective control, it is recommended that at least two of the above insecticides be rotated at each spraying. Follow label directions closely for dosage rates, spray intervals and precautions. Spray the undersides of the leaves thoroughly.\n",
