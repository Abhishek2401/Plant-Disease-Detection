Diseases,Symptoms,Treatment
Apple___Apple_scab,Pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves.,"1.Choose resistant varieties when possible.
2.Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.
3.Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
4.Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
5.For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop."
Apple___Black_rot,Large brown rotten areas.,"1.Prune out dead or diseased branches.
2.Pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees.
3.Remove infected plant material from the area.
4.All infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site.
5.Be sure to remove the stumps of any apple trees you cut down. Dead stumps can be a source of spores."
Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,Pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom.,"1.Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
2.Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
3.Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
4.On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.                                                                                                                    5.Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects."

Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew,Raised blister-like areas.,"Powdery mildew is most important during summers with hot, dry
weather. The fungal pathogen requires little moisture for spore germination and growth on leaf
surfaces. As little moisture as that present from high humidity from fog can stimulate spore
germination and growth; intermittent rains can provide enough moisture to initiate epidemics.
Powdery mildew typically is first seen on the underside of leaves and so orchard scouting is
important for initial disease detection.Conditions suitable for powdery mildew are less favorable
for cherry leaf spot and brown rot. Thus, during hot, dry summers, growers are apt to spray less
fungicides for disease control, resulting in less suppression of powdery mildew. In years
favorable for leaf spot and brown rot, mildew is typically less of a problem in part because
growers are spraying more frequently."
Cherry_(including_sour)___healthy,No Symptoms, No treatment required. Plant is healthy.
Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot,Small necrotic(dead) spots with chlorotic halos on leaves.,"1.Cercospora zeae-maydis overwinters in corn debris, so production practices such as tillage and crop rotation that reduce the amount corn residue on the surface will decrease the amount of primary inoculum.
2.Crop rotation away from corn can reduce disease pressure, but multiple years may be necessary in no-till scenarios.                                                                         3.Planting hybrids with a high level of genetic resistance can help reduce the risk of yield loss due to gray leaf spot infection.                                                                                4.During the growing season, foliar fungicides can be used to manage gray leaf spot outbreaks.
5.Farmers must consider the cost of the application and market value of their corn before determining if fungicides will be an economical solution to GLS."
Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_,Oval to elongate cinnamon brown pustules scattered over upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.,"1.Maize rusts are generally controlled by the use of resistant maize hybrids, and by foliar applications of fungicides on sweet corn.                                                       2.The use of resistant varieties is the best way of managing rust diseases. Two types of resistance exist: partial resistant and qualitative resistance. Partial resistance (or tolerance) results in fewer pustules, reduced sporulation, and lower germination rates. Disease spread and the development of epidemics are slower. Qualitative resistance is based on single genes providing total resistance. The trouble with this kind of resistance is that it may encourage the selection of new strains of the rust that can overcome varietal resistance."
Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight,Cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.,"1.The primary management strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of NCLB is planting resistant products.
2.Two types of resistance to NCLB exist in corn. Polygenic (multiple gene) resistance is expressed in plants as a reduction in lesion size, lesion number and sporulation, and a longer latent period before conidia are produced. Monogenic (single gene) resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene and can be expressed as chlorotic lesions with decreased sporulation.
3.A combination of rotating away from corn for one year followed by tillage is recommended to prevent the development of NCLB. Rotating to a non-host crop can reduce disease levels by allowing the corn debris on which the fungus survives to decompose before corn is planted again. Burying residue may help reduce infection levels by decreasing the amount of primary inoculum available in the spring. In no-till and reduced-tillage fields with a history of NCLB, a two-year rotation away from corn may be necessary. "

Grape___Black_rot,"Relatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves.","1.Mancozeb, and Ziram are all highly effective against black rot. Because these fungicides are strictly protectants, they must be applied before the fungus infects or enters the plant. They protect fruit and foliage by preventing spore germination. They will not arrest lesion development after infection has occurred.                                                      2.Sanitation is extremely important. Destroy mummies, remove diseased tendrils
from the wires, and select fruiting canes without lesions. It is very important not
to leave mummies attached to the vine.                           3.Plant grapes in sunny open areas that allow good air movement. If your vines are
planted under trees in the shade where they do not get all day sunlight, black rot
will be much more difficult to control. Shaded areas keep the leaves and fruits
from drying and provide excellent conditions for black rot infection and disease
development."
Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles),Tiger stripe' pattern on the leaves.,"1.Delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) has been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection.                          2.Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January.                       3.Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it. Vine surgery involves retraining new cordons or trunks as needed to maintain production."
Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot),Lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later.,"1. Apply dormant sprays to reduce inoculum levels
2. Cut it out. In addition to dormant sprays, growers should physically remove as much inoculum as possible, either by chopping up the prunings and burning them or burying large trunks to destroy fungal pathogens.
3. Open up that canopy. Open canopies have a number of benefits for disease control: They reduce relative humidity to discourage fungal attack, increase sunlight exposure to toughen fruit skins and kill fungal spores, and improve spray coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4. Use protectant and systemic fungicides. Protectants such as mancozeb and ziram can provide economical early-season control, especially for Phomopsis and black rot, and sulfur may be used for early powdery mildew control in cultivars that are not sulfur-sensitive.
5.To reduce the risk of grape pathogens developing fungicide resistance, growers should strive to make fewer fungicide sprays and alternate between fungicide groups, as delineated by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) numbers on labels. This applies mostly to systemic fungicides. "

Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening),"Twig dieback,Leaf yellowing,Green, misshapen fruit,Blotchy mottle on leaves (a random yellowing pattern).","1.For now, there is no cure for HLB, and no resistant citrus varieties are available. Management is difficult, but certain strategies can slow the spread of the disease. These include planting disease-free nursery stock, removing infected trees, managing psyllids and promoting root health.
2.Some cultural practices can be effective in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration.
3.Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough."
Peach___Bacterial_spot," spots, leaf spots and twig cankers","1.Bacterial spot is a difficult disease to control when environmental conditions favor pathogen spread. As with all bacterial plant diseases, there are relatively few bactericide chemicals available for use. Compounds available for use on peach and nectarine for bacterial spot include copper, oxytetracycline (Mycoshield and generic equivalents), and syllit+captan; however, repeated applications are typically necessary for even minimal disease control.
2.Oxytetracycline is generally considered the most effective compound and the least prone to phytotoxicity problems (damage to plant tissue), but also perhaps most likely to lose effectiveness with the appearance of bacterial strains with resistance. There is some evidence that the hydrochloride form of oxytetracycline (Fireline) is more effective than the calcium form Mycoshield."
Peach___healthy,No Symptoms, No treatment required. Plant is healthy.
"Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot","Necrotic spots may appear on leaves, stems, and fruits,leaf spots turn dark brown, and are slightly raised.","1.Either seed treatment should be done within a few weeks of planting. Best is doing right before planting as treatment can prime seed for germination. Afterwards a fungicide can be applied to prevent damping-off and other pathogens from infecting seeds. There are several formulations of Thiram registered for application as a dust or slurry.
2.Warm, wet conditions are favorable for diseases caused by bacteria. Therefore, irrigation method is an important consideration in managing BLS in the field. Overhead irrigation provides both a means of spread for the pathogen and favorable conditions for disease development, therefore trickle irrigation is recommended.
3.Low nitrogen or potassium, and extra high magnesium and calcium levels have been associated with increased crop susceptibility to BLS. Pepper crops that show visible signs of nitrogen deficiency (light colored leaves) have been severely affected by BLS in Connecticut. Researchers have also found that BLS is more severe on pepper plants grown in soils adjusted with dolomitic lime, which is high in magnesium, than plants grown in soils adjusted with Cal limestone (CaCO3). Maintain nutrients at the proper levels (moderate to high) to help plants resist infection."

Potato___Early_blight,"Small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage,tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow,concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area,Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves.","1.Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties.
2.Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible.That is, do not replant potatoes or other crops in this family for 2 years after a potato crop has been harvested.
3.Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease.
4.Only dig the tubers up when they are completely mature to prevent from damaging them. Any damage done at harvest can additionally facilitate the disease. Remove plant debris and weed hosts at the end of the season to mitigate areas where the disease may overwinter."
Potato___Late_blight,"Affected leaves appear blistered as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out,Affected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh.","1.Plant resistant cultivars when available.
2.Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
3.Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day , avoid overhead irrigation.
4.Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup)."

Soybean___healthy,No Symptoms, No treatment required. Plant is healthy.
Squash___Powdery_mildew,"Pale yellow leaf spots,white powdery spots can form on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.","1.Ensure there is enough spacing between your plants to provide enough airflow around all parts of the plant.
2.Don't over fertilize your plants. New growth tends to be very susceptible to powdery mildew development.
3.Put plants where they will get enough light and avoid overly shady locations.
4.Make sure the soil can drain properly. Inadequate drainage can make soil a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms.
5.Use compost to boost the nutrient levels in the soil, which will in turn increase beneficial microorganism populations.Keep plants properly maintained by removing any dead or diseased foliage and stems."
Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,"Numerous small, irregular, purplish spots or ""blotches"" that develop on the upper surface of leaves,the centers of the blotches become brownish.","1.leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention.
2.Since this fungal pathogen over winters on the fallen leaves of infect plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.
3.When making new plantings, always ensure that good planting practices are implemented. These practices include the use of proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation, and the use of drip irrigation. The avoidance of waterlogged soil and frequent garden cleanup will help to reduce the likelihood of spread of this fungus.

Strawberry___healthy,No Symptoms, No treatment required. Plant is healthy.
Tomato___Bacterial_spot,"Leaf lesions that are initially circular and water-soaked and may be surrounded by a faint yellow halo,spots are dark brown to black and circular on leaves and stems.","1.A plant with bacterial spot cannot be cured.  Remove symptomatic plants from the field or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants.  Burn, bury or hot compost the affected plants and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit.
2.Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.
3.Burn, bury or hot compost tomato debris at the end of the season.  Wait at least one year before planting tomatoes in a given location again, and remove and burn, bury or hot compost any volunteer tomatoes that come up in your garden.
"
Tomato___Early_blight,"Initially, small dark spots form on older foliage near the ground,leaf spots are round, brown and can grow up to half inch in diameter,larger spots have target-like concentric rings,severely infected leaves turn brown and fall off, or dead, dried leaves may cling to the stem.","1.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.
2.Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
3.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.
4.Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.
5.For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.
"
Tomato___Late_blight,"Firm, dark brown, circular spots grow to cover large parts of fruits,spots may become mushy as secondary bacteria invade.","1.Plant resistant cultivars when available.
2.Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
3.Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day  avoid overhead irrigation.
4.Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest."
Tomato___Leaf_Mold,"The primary symptom appear on the upper surface of infected leaves as a small spot pale green or yellowish with indefinite margins, and on corresponding area of the lower surface, the fungus begins to sporulate.","1.Upon noticing the infected areas, the first step is to let the plants air out and dry. If they are being cultivated in a greenhouse, expose them to dry air conditions, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive and thrive is dried up in the open air.
2.If the tomatoes are being cultivated outdoors, try to keep the leaves dry when watering the plants. One thing you can do to help keep the leaves as dry as possible is to water in the early morning hours, that way the plant has plenty of time to dry before the sun comes out, which will keep the humidity around the leaves low.
3.You can also try drip irrigation methods, or soak watering methods to attempt to water the soil without ever wetting the leaves of the plant.
4.Another treatment option is fungicidal sprays. When using fungicide sprays, be sure to thoroughly cover all parts of the plant that is above ground, focusing specifically on the underside of leaves. Calcium chloride sprays are among the most highly recommended types for leaf mold.
"
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,"Small, round to irregular spots with a grey center and dark margin on leaves,Spots coalesce and leaves are blighted,Stems and flowers are sometimes attacked,Complete defoliation of affected leaves.","1.When selecting fruit trees, choose resistant varieties if possible.
2.Keep the soil under the tree clean and rake up fallen fruit.
3.Use a thick layer of mulch to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will reduce weeds and prevent the disease pathogen from splashing back up onto the leaves.
4.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
5.Leaf spot among vegetables is most often introduced through infected seed or transplants. Make sure your seeds and transplants are from leaf spot-free stock."
Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite," Leaves of mite-infested plants may turn yellow and dry up, and plants may lose vigor and die when infestations are severe. The undersides of affected leaves appear tan or yellow and have a crusty texture. Heavy infestations of the two-spotted spider mite produce fine webbing that may cover the entire plant.","1.The best way to begin treating for two-spotted mites is to apply a pesticide specific to mites called a miticide. Ideally, you should start treating for two-spotted mites before your plants are seriously damaged.
2.Watch for spider mites in greenhouses where vegetable transplants are growing. Also scout eggplants in the field. Checking for mites must be done by examining foliage.
3.Mites often develop as localized infestations on particular groups of plants such as beans or tomatoes. Sample plants by turning over leaves and with a hands-free magnifier (Optivisor) or hand lens, check for the presence of spider mites as well as symptoms or webbing.
4.Preventative releases of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, may suppress TSSM populations in greenhousese and vegetable fields."
Tomato___Target_Spot,"Target spot symptoms begin as small dark lesions which enlarges to form light brown lesions with concentric pattern and a yellow halo around it in the transplants.Symptoms on stems also begin as small lesions, which rapidly enlarge and elongate. These lesions may eventually become large enough to girdle the stem, resulting in the collapse of the tissues above that point.","1.Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.
2.Rotate crops and don't plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year – primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.
3.Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren't crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.
4.Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit to mulch to 3 inches or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails."
Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,"Typical symptoms for this disease in tomato are yellow (chlorotic) leaf edges, upward leaf cupping, leaf mottling, reduced leaf size, and flower drop.","1.symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost! The goal is to remove the plant reservoir of virus from the garden and to trap the existing virus-bearing whiteflies so they do not disperse onto other tomatoes.
2.If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost.
3.Inspect plants for whitefly infestations two times per week. If whiteflies are beginning to appear, spray with azadirachtin (Neem), pyrethrin or insecticidal soap. For more effective control, it is recommended that at least two of the above insecticides be rotated at each spraying. Follow label directions closely for dosage rates, spray intervals and precautions. Spray the undersides of the leaves thoroughly."
Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,"Mottled light and dark green on leaves,Leaves may be curled, malformed, or reduced in size.","1.Spot treat with least-toxic, natural pest control products, such as Safer Soap, Bon-Neem and diatomaceous earth, to reduce the number of disease carrying insects.
2.Remove all perennial weeds, using least-toxic herbicides, within 100 yards of your garden plot.
3.The virus can be spread through human activity, tools and equipment. Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination.
4.Avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet).
5.Avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants. Cigarettes and other tobacco products may be infected and can spread the virus.
Remove and destroy all infected plants."
